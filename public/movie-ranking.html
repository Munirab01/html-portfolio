<H1>MOVIE RECOMMENDATION BY MB</H1>
<h2>MY TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h2><hr>
<h3>HASEE TOH PHASEE</h3>
<h4>This is one of my favourite movies and will always remain the same. This movie is highly underrated but that is the beauty of it.<br>
    Nikhil, ( Siddharth Malhotra) is a guy any girl would wish for. He is so caring, emotional and loving. <br>
    Meeta ( Parineeti Chopra ) is an interesting character. She is not a jealous, gossip monger , attention seeker kind of girl. She is so smart and focussed. <br>
    The bond between them is the most wholesome thing i have seen in a long time</h4>
<h3>MANMARZIYAN</h3>
<h4><p>#Manmarziyan - A modern day Selfish, Mutual Favour Love traingle story.<br>
     The Bold, the reckless with hyper androgen harmone active  Rumi is in #Fyaar with irresponsible, opportunist Vicky. 
     Just like #Woh7Din or #HumDilDeChukeSanam, their love is get succumbed to pressure to marry London Banker Robby.
    Rumi struggles in choice between irresponisbilities Vs Maturity, fast vs slow, Family Vs Yaar, Pyar Vs Fyaar, but love likes to
     settle, even if it has started in the storm.</p>
    <p>This is unconventional mainstream movie directed by Anurag  Kashyap.<br>
    He is just fantastic in unconventional imaginative narrator, be it using twin dancers as PROPS or
    be is painful walk down the streets of amritsar in conclusion. He has just made another #masterpiece.</p></h4>
